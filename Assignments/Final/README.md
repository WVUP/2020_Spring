The final is worth 200 points so be sure to get all the checkboxes completed.  We have been prepping for this for a couple of weeks so should have a good starting point. Like all other projects this needs to be submitted as a PR through GitHub.

#### The requirements:  
[ ] Must have working navigation  
[ ] Must have 3-5 pages (which pages you pick is mostly up to you)  
[ ] Utilization of icons  
[ ] Utilization of images  
[ ] One "Feed" style page (Home/Adoption pages are examples of such)  
[ ] Layout needs to be _resemble_ storyboard. This primarily meaning that the page html design was _intentional_.  It does not have to be a 1:1 but it needs to show _intentional_ design.
[ ] JavaScript - On the "Feed" page use JavaScript to generate the feed items.
_Example_
```
const posts = [
  {
    title: 'Some title',
    imageUrl: 'http://.....',
    price: 2.99,
    qty: 5,
    contact: '',
    ...etc
  }
];
// TODO: Render these items in markup on the page
```  

[ ] JavaScript - Allow user to filter these products (by search, dropdown, etc.,)  
[ ] Include form **input** and form **validation** (ex: create new feed item)  
[ ] Site needs to look polished enough to hand off. Meaning, not half-done and looking partially incomplete


##### Bonus
[ ] Responsive
[ ] Implement the masonry/packery auto-sizing image wall (Explore page)
