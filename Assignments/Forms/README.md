## Forms Assignment
This assignment is to create a page that requires form input.  What type of form you create is up to you.  Could be to build a new product, register for a site, survey, etc., etc., etc.,  What is important is using the various types of inputs to collect user information.  Placeholder text is always welcomed as well.  

Here are just _some_ of the types we discussed:
- text
- password
- textarea
- select
- radio
- checkbox
- url
- email
- submit

These will need to use the native HTML5 validation.  Such as automatically check for `required` fields, using the appropriate `type` of input to ensure correct validation.  Try to challenge yourself to validate things that would make sense in a real application. Remember fields only validate when the form attempts to submit (unless you call programmatically from JS)...

### JavaScript

The next part of the assignment was to utilize JavaScript (just like in class) to access the form.  We want to obtain the input that the user has typed to display them **ON THE SCREEN**.  If you struggle with this, at a minimum, utilize `console.log()` but the real goal is to get them on the screen.  We did examples in class on accessing values as well as updating the UI in real time with the users input.  You do not have to go quite as fancy but challenge yourself if you are making good progress.
