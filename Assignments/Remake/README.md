## Remake WVUP landing page
This assignment is to re-create the [WVUP website](https://www.wvup.edu/) landing page.  Try to use the skills we have learned so far to position and style the page to match what exists.  This is a great way to have a design goal already supplied where you can focus on how to _layout_ your code structure.

#### Additional Info
- You do not need to recreate every possible menu link..or even have working links.  The goal is to get the design as close to matching as possible...not all that extra tedious stuff
- The diaganol coloring for the menu items...dont stress over that.  See about getting colors to work on hover and the basic functionality...consider the diaganol styling as bonus
- The animating in of content is also just bonus...dont feel the need to solve that
