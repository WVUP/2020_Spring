            <h3>About Me</h3>
            I was raised by a single father who taught me everything he knew about physics, engineering, and programming. By the age of 10 I
            had the opportunity to be accepted into a collegiate degree. I turned it down in favor of an apprenticeship with some of the 
            greatest minds of the modern age. By 18 I took over my father's energy company and recreated it into an engineering firm, focused
            on creating a new sustainable energy source.
