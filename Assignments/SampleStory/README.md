### Storybook

This assignment is to build a storybook for the following site (which the class agreed on last week).

Local Market
- Allow users to barter services and goods (semi craigslist but not sucky)
- Allow users to view store fronts to see products, goods for sale or adoption (in the case of pets)
- Allow users to upload, listen and participate with other members with digital audio
- Registration page
- Can users share listings?
- Commenting support? Liking?
- Navigation, Categories, tags?
- A section for potential blogging (how things are going, etc.,)
- Mobile support (how does it look on mobile)
    - Can use an iPhone/android png or just box it in to rough proportions 


You can use any technology to build this you want.
